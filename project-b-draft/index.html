            <h2>The Idea </h2>
            <p>There once was a broke 21-year-old 
            college student named Alex. 
            Struggling with the weight of 
            tuition fees, loans, and rent,
            Alex felt the desperate need 
            to make some money.
            One day, while scrolling through the his 
            instagram reels, an idea sparked 
            in Alex's mind: the casino. </p>

            <h2>The Couch</h2>
            <p>With dreams of hitting the jackpot, 
            Alex decided to go to the
            glittering world of a local casino. 
            Finding a few dollars
            from the back of the couch, 
            Alex set out to the casino.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>The Casino </h2>
        <p> Entering the casino, the dazzling lights 
            and the hypnotic sounds of 
            slot machines welcomed 
            Alex into a world of possibilities. 
            With heart pounding, 
            Alex approached the BLACKJACK table, 
            with a mixture of excitement and nervousness.
            He had never played BLACKJACK before, so the 
            dealer explained the rules: 
        </p>
        <p> Goal:
            The Goal of BlackJack is to get a value 
            as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
        </p>

        <p> Card Values:
            Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
            Face cards are each worth 10.
            Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is better for the hand.
        </p>

        <p> How To Play:
            You and the dealer are dealt two cards each.
            You can choose to "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand).
            If your total exceeds 21, you lose (bust).
            If you don't bust, the dealer hits until their hand is 17 or higher.
            If the dealer busts or if your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win.
        </p>

        <p> Winning conditions:
            If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without busting, you win.
            If the dealer busts, you win.
        </p>

        <h2>The Realization</h2>
        <p> Luck was on Alex's side!
            Just from a couple of games in BLACKJACK, 
            Alex's money skyrocketed.
            Inspired by this initial success, 
            Alex decided to try his hand at the slot machines.
            However, the hard earned money that 
            he gained from BLACKJACK seemed to all have gone.

        <h2>The Loss </h2>
        <p>In a final act of desperation, 
            Alex placed a the rest of his money on a high-stakes roulette game. 
            Alex decided to hedge his bets on a color...
            Luck had abandoned Alex, and the final bet failed.
            With empty pockets and a heavy heart, 
            Alex left the casino, realizing that
            sometimes, making money fast just isn't possible.
