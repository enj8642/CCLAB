                <p>This creature shown on the left is a virus that lives in space. 
                    It moves in a circular motion to protect itself from the dangers in space, like planets, asteroids, stars, and moons. 
                    If something dangerous touches it (like a mouse click), it will erratically move around to try to protect itself. Once
                    the danger disappears, it will return to its normal state. Otherwise, it will try to infect anything that it touches, 
                    turning its unsuspecting victims into more viruses. Because of its' recent discovery, no known solution has been found 
                    yet to cure the virus. </p>
